# DAG < APT database

The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive database of borrowings from Arabic, Persian and Turkic in the languages of Dagestan. Data come from available etymological literature.

The database consists of:

* **sources** a list of sources on borrowings from Arabic, Persian and Turkic in the languages of Dagestan (not exhaustive)
* **concepts** a list of donor lexemes attested in the sources we have digitized so far
* **database** combination of datasets with target lexemes identified as borrowings (each digitized source is a separate dataset) and information about donor lexemes from **concepts**
  + **zabitov2001** dataset with target lexemes identified in Zabitov (2001)

## Updates
